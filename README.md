# Mathematical Physics

In Mathematical Physics, We study 

1. Calculus Functions
2. First Order Differential Equations
3. Second Order Differential Equations
4. Vector Analysis Vector Algebra, Vector Differentiation and Integration. 
5. Probability and Statistics is also a main part of this course.

In Programming part, We used different numerical methods like 

1. Euler Method
2. Trapezoidal and Simpson Method
3. RK2 and RK4 Method 
4. Gauss Elimination
5. Gauss-Seidel 

to solve different physics problems.
